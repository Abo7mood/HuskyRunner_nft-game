## Story of this game 📚
--------------------------

This game was created as a **solo project**, inspired by the beauty of winter and the energy of huskies. I wanted to build a **fast-paced endless runner** where players could experience the thrill of dashing through the snow while collecting rewards. 

The **coin collection and scoring system** were designed to encourage players to keep improving their runs, making each playthrough more exciting than the last. Balancing the **winter obstacles** added an extra layer of challenge, ensuring that quick reflexes and smart maneuvers are essential for success. 

Developing this project allowed me to explore **endless runner mechanics** and fine-tune a fun and engaging gameplay loop. I hope players enjoy guiding the husky through this frozen adventure as much as I enjoyed creating it! ❄️🐾
